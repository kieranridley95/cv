        <p><em>Freelance Developer</em></p>
        <p> In 2018 I completed a Bachelor‚Äôs in Applied Business Computing which inspired me to seek an opportunity to become part of an industry that allows me to apply the skills I have learned and put them into practice. 
        I desire to work in an environment that offers the opportunity for myself to engage with colleagues and be given responsibilities to achieve goals. 
        Furthermore, I am keen to enhance my current capabilities through progress that will allow me to become more reliable to an employer and contribute to a dedicated and practical working team.</p>

                that needed to be stored was from investors and donators for the business centre and for graduates

                My solution was an android application that would be used by the staff to store records onto a backend
                database. The skills I to achieve the product of this project was using Java, XML, MySQL and
                PHP.

                you to search for the product via the barcode, update the stock and calculate an order. The language
                I used to create this was Java.
